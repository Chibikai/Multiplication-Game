The 1st commit was to get the game up and running. 
Since the game is working, I will start implementing code to help with breaking down and showing the player how to get the answer. 
By doing so, I will encourage the player to interact and respond during the breakdown. 
This game is to help children practice and encourage learning at the same time.

The end game is to have a pleasing design and entertaining game for children to play.
